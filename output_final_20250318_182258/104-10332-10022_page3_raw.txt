This document is primarily administrative in nature, detailing the JFK Assassination Records Review Board's requirements for the CIA's "Statement of Compliance" with the JFK Act. While not containing direct evidence about the assassination itself, it provides insight into what records government investigators considered important nearly 35 years after the event, particularly focusing on intelligence operations related to Cuba and Mexico City - areas connected to Oswald's activities in the months before the assassination.
