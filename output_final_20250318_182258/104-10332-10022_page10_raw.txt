The document appears to be correspondence between the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) and a CIA representative (J. Barry Harrelson) from April 16, 1997. It shows the ARRB's process for requesting and prioritizing CIA records related to the JFK assassination investigation, particularly focusing on six high-priority issues that include Oswald's pre-assassination files and CIA operations in Mexico City - both significant areas of research in understanding Oswald's activities before the assassination.
