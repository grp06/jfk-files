This document appears to be an administrative letter dated December 9, 1996, from Michael J. O'Neil (likely a CIA official) to David G. Maxwell (likely associated with the JFK Assassination Records Review Board). The letter discusses the process by which the CIA is responding to information requests related to the JFK Act. It contains no direct information about the assassination itself, but rather documents the bureaucratic process of records disclosure and compliance with the Review Board's requests for information. The letter mentions that CIA officials have provided sworn testimony at an open hearing on August 6, 1996, and provides a contact in the Office of General Counsel for further questions.
