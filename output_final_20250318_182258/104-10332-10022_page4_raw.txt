# Document Analysis: JFK Records Collection Compliance Process

This document appears to be page 4 of a letter dated November 27, 1996, addressed to The Honorable John M. Deutch, likely the CIA Director at that time. The document outlines procedures and requirements for federal agencies to comply with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act (JFK Act).

## Key Elements of the Document:

The page contains several administrative sections detailing requirements for agencies regarding assassination-related records:

1. Section c asks for explanations about any destroyed assassination-related records
2. Section d requests information on remaining work needed to comply with the JFK Act
3. Point 3 outlines a Review Board interview process with Agency Compliance Officials scheduled for January 1997
4. Point 4 details the submission of Final Agency Declarations of Compliance by July 1, 1997

This document is not a primary source about the JFK assassination itself, but rather a much later administrative document (from 1996) outlining the government's process for collecting and declassifying assassination-related records as required by the JFK Act. It indicates formal procedures for federal agencies (with special mention of the CIA) to account for all assassination-related records, including explaining any destroyed records.

The document references the Assassination Records Review Board, which was established by the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 to gather and oversee the release of records related to the assassination.

This appears to be a procedural document showing the government's efforts, decades after the assassination, to ensure comprehensive collection and public access to assassination-related records from various federal agencies.
