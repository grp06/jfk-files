Tenet asserts that the CIA has fully met its obligations to locate, review, and release 'assassination records' as defined in the Act.

However, its substance represents the CIA's position rather than independent verification of compliance.",
    "historical_significance": "This document demonstrates that 35 years after the assassination, the CIA was still addressing questions about its disclosure of assassination-related records. It also shows the formal culmination of the ARRB process requiring agencies to certify their compliance with the JFK Records Act, indicating the challenges of ensuring complete government transparency on this historical event.",
